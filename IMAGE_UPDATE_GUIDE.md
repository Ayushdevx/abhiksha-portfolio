# Image Update Instructions

## Current Status:
✅ Your portfolio is configured to use `/abhi.jpg` as your profile picture
✅ The image should now be visible in both the hero section and about section

## To Update with Your New Image:

### Method 1: Replace the existing file
1. Save the new image you've provided as `abhi.jpg`
2. Copy it to: `E:\space-portfolio-main\public\abhi.jpg`
3. Replace the existing file
4. Refresh your browser at http://localhost:3000

### Method 2: Use a different filename
1. Save your image as `abhiksha-profile.jpg`
2. Copy it to: `E:\space-portfolio-main\public\abhiksha-profile.jpg`
3. The code will automatically use this file

## Image Specifications:
- **Recommended size:** 400x400 pixels or larger (square format)
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **File size:** Keep under 500KB for fast loading
- **Quality:** High resolution for crisp display

## Verification:
After updating the image, you should see your profile picture in:
1. **Hero Section:** Smaller circular image overlaid on the space background
2. **About Section:** Larger circular image with purple border and glow effect

## Current File Locations:
- Main profile image: `public/abhi.jpg` (78KB - likely your current image)
- Placeholder: `public/abhiksha-profile.jpg` (123 bytes - just a placeholder)

## Note:
The development server is running, so changes to images in the public folder should be reflected immediately after a browser refresh.
