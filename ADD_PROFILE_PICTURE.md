# Instructions to Add Your Profile Picture

## Steps to add your profile picture to the portfolio:

1. **Save your profile image:**
   - Save the attached profile image as `abhiksha-profile.jpg`
   - The image should be in JPG format for best compatibility

2. **Copy to the correct location:**
   - Copy the `abhiksha-profile.jpg` file to the `public` folder
   - Full path should be: `e:\space-portfolio-main\public\abhiksha-profile.jpg`

3. **Alternative formats:**
   - If you prefer PNG format, save as `abhiksha-profile.png`
   - Update the image references in the code:
     - In `components/sub/hero-content.tsx` (line ~60)
     - In `components/main/about.tsx` (line ~22)
   - Change `/abhiksha-profile.jpg` to `/abhiksha-profile.png`

## Image recommendations:
- **Recommended size:** 400x400 pixels or larger (square format works best)
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **File size:** Keep under 500KB for fast loading
- **Quality:** High resolution for crisp display on retina screens

## Verification:
After adding the image, you should see your profile picture displayed in:
1. The hero section (smaller circular image overlaid on the background)
2. The about section (larger circular image with purple border)

## Note:
The placeholder file `abhiksha-profile.jpg` currently exists but needs to be replaced with your actual image file.
